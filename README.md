# Caption-Generator

In this repositry i have created an tool that generates captions when given image as input.
I used a VisionEncoderDecoderModel ,ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer classes from transformers library.
I used an existing pretrained model from Huggingface website.
In this model ViT is used as Encoder and GPT2 is used as Decoder
